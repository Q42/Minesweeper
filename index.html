    <h2>What it is</h2>

    <p>Minesweeper: Don't Panic! is a modern implementation of the classic logic game.</p>
    
    <p>It can be played on all the devices you know and love: iPhone, iPad, Mac and even on your Apple Watch.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <p>Click on a square to reveal it. If it's a mine, you lose. If it's a number, it tells you how many mines are in the surrounding squares. If it's blank, it means there are no mines in the surrounding squares. You can use this information to deduce where the mines are and click on them to reveal them.</p>

    <p>Right-click on a square to flag it as a mine. If you flag all the mines, you win!</p>
